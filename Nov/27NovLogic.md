Let’s break down the provided code with a dry run for clarity. The code attempts to calculate the shortest distance from node `0` to every other node after applying a series of directed edge updates (`queries`). Here is how it works:


# java
```java
class Solution {
    private void updateDistances(List<List<Integer>> graph, int current, int[] distances) {
        int newDist = distances[current] + 1;
        
        for (int neighbor : graph.get(current)) {
            if (distances[neighbor] <= newDist) continue;
            
            distances[neighbor] = newDist;
            updateDistances(graph, neighbor, distances);
        }
    }
    
    public int[] shortestDistanceAfterQueries(int n, int[][] queries) {
        int[] distances = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            distances[i] = n - 1 - i;
        }
        
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i + 1 < n; ++i) {
            graph.get(i + 1).add(i);
        }
        
        int[] answer = new int[queries.length];
        int queryIdx = 0;
        
        for (int[] query : queries) {
            int source = query[0];
            int target = query[1];
            
            graph.get(target).add(source);
            distances[source] = Math.min(distances[source], distances[target] + 1);
            updateDistances(graph, source, distances);
            
            answer[queryIdx++] = distances[0];
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
}
```




### **Initial Observations**
1. **Input Parameters:**
   - `n`: Number of nodes (indexed from `0` to `n-1`).
   - `queries`: An array of pairs representing new directed edges.

2. **Output:**
   - An array where each element represents the shortest distance from node `0` to all other nodes after processing each query.

3. **Key Components:**
   - `distances`: Tracks the shortest distance from node `0` to each node.
   - `graph`: Adjacency list representing the directed graph.
   - `updateDistances`: Recursive function to update distances after a query.

### **Dry Run**

#### Input Example
```java
n = 5;
queries = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {0, 3}};
```

---

#### Step 1: **Initialization**
- `distances`: Initially, the distance from `0` to other nodes is set to `n-1-i`.  
  ```
  distances = {4, 3, 2, 1, 0} (as `n-1-i` for i = 0 to n-1)
  ```

- `graph`: Initialize an adjacency list for `n` nodes. Add a default edge from `i+1` to `i`:
  ```
  graph = [[], [0], [1], [2], [3]]
  ```

---

#### Step 2: **Process Queries**
We process each query in the `queries` array and update the graph and distances.

---

##### Query 1: `{1, 2}`
- **New Edge:** Add a directed edge from `1` to `2`.
  ```
  graph = [[], [0], [1], [2], [3], [1->2]]
  ```

- **Update Distances:**  
  Distance from `1` (`source`) may be reduced via `2` (`target`):
  ```
  distances[1] = min(distances[1], distances[2] + 1) = min(3, 2+10`;
}+

### Dry Run Continued

#### Query 1: `{1, 2}` (continued)
- After adding the edge `1 → 2`, the updated distance for `1` is calculated:
  ```
  distances[1] = min(3, 2 + 1) = 3.
  ```
  However, no further updates are needed since `distances[1]` does not decrease.  

- **Result after Query 1:**  
  ```
  distances = {4, 3, 2, 1, 0}.
  answer[0] = distances[0] = 4.
  ```

---

#### Query 2: `{3, 4}`
- **New Edge:** Add a directed edge from `3 → 4`:
  ```
  graph = [[], [0], [1], [2], [3, 4]].
  ```

- **Update Distances:**  
  Distance from `3` via `4` is updated:
  ```
  distances[3] = min(distances[3], distances[4] + 1) = min(1, 0 + 1) = 1.
  ```
  Since `distances[3]` does not decrease further, no recursive updates are made.

- **Result after Query 2:**  
  ```
  distances = {4, 3, 2, 1, 0}.
  answer[1] = distances[0] = 4.
  ```

---

#### Query 3: `{0, 3}`
- **New Edge:** Add a directed edge from `0 → 3`:
  ```
  graph = [[3], [0], [1], [2], [3, 4]].
  ```

- **Update Distances:**  
  Distance from `0` via `3`:
  ```
  distances[0] = min(distances[0], distances[3] + 1) = min(4, 1 + 1) = 2.
  ```
  After this update, the recursive function `updateDistances` checks neighbors of `0` and updates other distances if possible, but no further updates are required in this case.

- **Result after Query 3:**  
  ```
  distances = {2, 3, 2, 1, 0}.
  answer[2] = distances[0] = 2.
  ```

---

### Final Output
After processing all queries, the result array is:
```
answer = {4, 4, 2}.
```

This represents the shortest distance from `0` to all other nodes after each query.
